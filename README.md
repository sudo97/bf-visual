# BF Runtime Simulator with Visuals

This project is a visual simulation of a theoretical processor, inspired by minimalist computational models like BF (IYKYK) and historical educational tools such as CARDIAC (Cardboard Illustrative Aid to Computation) and other paper computers. The simulator is designed to demonstrate the workings of a processor using a limited set of operations, providing an interactive and educational experience on how simple instructions can be orchestrated to perform complex tasks.

## Technologies Used

The simulator is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. React provides the UI components, TypeScript offers type safety, and Vite ensures fast development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). The project also utilizes ESLint to maintain code quality, configured specifically for TypeScript and React to ensure best practices.

- **React**: For building the user interface with component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static types to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and readability.
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the development experience with features like instant server start and lightning-fast HMR.

## Historical Context

The concept draws parallels to early educational computers like CARDIAC, which were used to teach the fundamentals of how computers operate. By simulating a BF runtime, users can engage with the core principles of computation—such as loops, conditionals, and memory management—in a controlled and visually appealing environment.
